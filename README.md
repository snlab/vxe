# VXE: SDN Function Instance Store as a Mechanism to Automatically Implement Intents

We implement VXE, a tool to provide a Virtual eXecution Environment for building function-instance-based system like [FAST](), and a demo system by using VXE.

## Problem and Goal

## Challenges

## Solution Overview

### Architecture



### Features

- Automatic extraction of dependent data <!--(why it is hard, what is clever; small amount of false positives)-->
- Automatic registration of listeners
- Automatic reexecution

## Hackathon Project

### Prerequisites

### VXE System

### VXE Library

## How to Run the Demo

Switch to the `demo` directory and execute:

~~~
mvn clean install exec:exec
~~~

> **Tips**
> 
> 1. Run `mvn checkstyle:check` at the root directory before pushing your changes.
